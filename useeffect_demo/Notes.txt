useEffect used to perform side effects

useEffect with no dependency array (2nd arg) - callback fn (1st arg) gets called on every render
useEffect with blank dependency array (2nd arg) - callback fn (1st arg) gets called only once on 1st render
useEffect with element inside dependency array (2nd arg) - callback fn (1st arg) gets called when the value of the dependencies gets changed

when state changes, component gets rendered
